This directory contains a simple example test case for Robot Framework SSHLibrary.

To run it, install SSHLibrary and issue:

    pybot executing_commands.txt

The host, username and password can be set from the commandline as following:

    pybot -v host:somehost -v user:somebody -v password:secret executing_commands.txt

For more examples, please take look at the library documentation at '../doc/SSHlibrary.html'
