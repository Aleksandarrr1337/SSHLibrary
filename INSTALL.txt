= Installation instructions =

There are two ways of installing SSH Library, depending on the distribution.

Installing using Windows binary installer is really straightforward, just 
double click the installer and follow the instructions.

To install from source distribution, the archive must be extracted and 
following command given in the resulting directory: `python setuo.py install`.
Root privileges may be required for the installation.

When running tests with Python, paramiko[1] is required to be in the PYTHONPATH
during execution. Similarly, when running tests with Jython, trilead[2] jar 
file must be found from the CLASSPATH. See Robot Framework user guide[3] for
more information about setting the environment for test execution.
